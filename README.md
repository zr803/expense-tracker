# Budget/Expense Tracker

## Program Intentions and Usage

For my project I want to create a budget tracking system for **students and workers**. 
Since coming to university and having to keep track of my own expenses, I have learned how quickly things can add up
and often find myself wondering how much I have spent so far. For a while I have been wanting to start 
writing it down, but I thought that this would be a good tool to create so that students like me, as well as workers
can have a place to keep track.

The application will allow users to create a tracker for their expenses, where they can input when they spent their 
money, on what they spent it, and how much it costed. They will also be able to get a total of their expenses and remove
an entry as well, which could be useful if they have paid that expense off. After the entries have been added the user 
will be able to produce a graphical table displaying all of this information in an organized manner. 


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to multiple expenses to my tracker.
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to view a list of expenses for which I have recorded.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a tracker and get how much my net expenses are.
- AS a user, I want to be able to remove an entry from the tracker once I have paid the expense off.
