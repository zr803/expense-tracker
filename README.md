# Expense Tracker

## Program Intentions

The application will allow users to create a tracker for their expenses, where they can input when they spent their 
money, on what they spent it, and how much it costed. They will also be able to get a total of their expenses and remove
an entry as well, which could be useful if they have paid that expense off. After the entries have been added the user 
will be able to produce a graphical table displaying all of this information in an organized manner.
