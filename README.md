# Bullet Journal Planning System

## Program Intentions and Usage

For my project I want to create a planning system for **students and workers**. 
Over the last couple of years I have grown to enjoy bullet journaling, which is basically like creating your own planner 
from scratch. Each month I design monthly spreads and weekly spreads, which usually consists of a calendar to write my 
due dates and space for each week, where I can write my homework for the day. In these spreads I have also been able to 
incorporate some creativity by adding themes for the month, such as a firework theme for the month of January. Since
coming to uni, my bullet journal has significantly helped me reduce my stress while simultaneously helping me to stay on
track with my assignments and tests. 

For simplicity in this I am focusing more on the structure of the calendar and weekly spreads instead of the decoration. 
However, I also think that making the graphics more minimalistic could make this more practical and marketable for a 
larger audience since some prefer to have more room for planning, instead of designs and drawings. I may make an option
to add some simple preset designs to add to the spreads for those who choose. This program will allow the user to create
monthly and weekly spreads, in which they can enter due dates and create to-do lists as well as add reminders. A more 
specific usage of this program could include a student creating a schedule to study for their finals, including what
they need to review leading up to the exam.
