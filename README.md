# Budget Tracker

## Program Intentions and Usage

For my project I want to create a budget tracking system for **students and workers**. 
Since coming to university and having to keep track of my own expenses, I have learned how quickly things can add up
and often find myself wondering how much I have spent throughout the month. For a while I have been wanting to start 
writing it down, but I thought that this would be a good tool to create so that students like me, as well as workers
can have a place to keep track.

The application will allow users to create a tracker for each month, where they can input when they spent their money,
on what they spent it, and how much it costed. They will also be able to input any earnings they have, and at the at end
of their entries they could get an expense total that will add up the expenses and earnings. After the entries the user
will be able to produce a graphical table displaying all of this information in an organized manner.
